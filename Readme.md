Differences between Flux and Redux

 In flux the store contains the state and the logic for changing the state, in redux store and logic change are seperate.
 Flux you can have multiple stores, redux has reducers so you have only one store
 In flux each store are seperate and disconnected, redux has only single store with heirachial reducers
 In flux state is mutated, redux state is immutable
